Trump wants Postal Service to charge 'much more' for Amazon shipments,seattlewashington reuters president donald trump called on the us postal service on friday to charge much more to ship packages for amazon amzno picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past why is the united states post office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making amazon richer and the post office dumber and poorer should be charging much more trump wrote on twitter the presidents tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the postal service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season the us postal service which runs at a big loss is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses according to its website package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of firstclass letters the president does not determine postal rates they are set by the postal regulatory commission an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties that panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in november amazon was founded by jeff bezos who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world according to bloomberg news bezos also owns the washington post a newspaper trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media in tweets over the past year trump has said the amazon washington post fabricated stories he has said amazon does not pay sales tax which is not true and so hurts other retailers part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big american companies since he took office in january daniel ives a research analyst at gbh insights said trumps comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant however he said he was not concerned for amazon we do not see any price hikes in the future however that is a risk that amazon is clearly aware of and it is building out its distribution system aggressively he said amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service including testing drones for deliveries in 2015 the company spent 115 billion on shipping 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year amazon shares were down 086 percent to 117590 by early afternoon overall us stock prices were down slightly on friday satish jindel president of shipmatrix inc which analyzes shipping data disputed the idea that the postal service charges less than united parcel service inc upsn and fedex corp fdxn the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the united states many customers get lower rates from ups and fedex than they would get from the post office for comparable services he said the postal service delivers about 62 percent of amazon packages for about 35 to 4 million a day during the current peak yearend holiday shipping season jindel said the seattlebased company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys from post offices to customers doorsteps amazons no 2 carrier is ups at 21 percent and fedex is third with 8 percent or so according to jindel trumps comment tapped into a debate over whether postal service pricing has kept pace with the rise of ecommerce which has flooded the mail with small packagesprivate companies like ups have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business steve gaut a spokesman for ups noted that the company values its productive relationship with the postal service but that it has filed with the postal regulatory commission its concerns about the postal services methods for covering costs representatives for amazon the white house the us postal service and fedex declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on trumps tweet according to its annual report the postal service lost 274 billion this year and its deficit has ballooned to 6186 billion while the postal services revenue for first class mail marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to 195 billion in the fiscal year ended sept 30 2017 but it also lost about 2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in april 2016 according to a government accountability office report in february the service is facing growing personnel expenses particularly 734 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities the postal service has not announced any plans to cut costs by law the postal service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service but the postal service allocates only 55 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue,politicsNews,"December 29,
